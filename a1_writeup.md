# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    It has a lot of interesting shortcuts to do things quicker, but there are multiple ways to approach every problem, and more methodical "java-esque" solutions also work.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
    Unlike Javascript, Python does not require semicolons at the end of every line. It is also very picky about variable type, having to declare the type of input and output variable for every function in advance. Also, there are no brackets used for functions, so spacing is more important.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
    I learned a bit more about how python works, learning how the range keyword works and how to use a for loop in python. I also learned how to define a function and how to declare the types of variables input and output into functions. I also figured out how to combine two strings.
