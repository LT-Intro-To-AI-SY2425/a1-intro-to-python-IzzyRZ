"""1. Number Properties
Write a program that takes a number as input and prints whether the number is even or odd.
2. Sum of Integers
Write a program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number n (where n is provided by the user).
3. Factorial Calculation
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number n (where n is provided by the user). Recall that the factorial of n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
4. Palindrome Checker
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., "madam" or "racecar").
5. Multiplication Table
Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10. The output should show the result of multiplying each number by every number in the range.
6. Prime Number Checker
Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
7. List Sum
Write a program that takes a list of integers and prints the sum of the integers in the list.
8. Temperature Converter
Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula for conversion is F = C * 9/5 + 32, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.
9. Count Vowels
Write a program that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
10. Odd Numbers in a List
Write a program that takes a list of integers and prints out all the odd numbers from the list.
11. Character Frequency
Write a program that takes a string and counts the frequency of each character in the string, then prints out the results.
12. Reverse a String
Write a program that takes a string and prints it in reverse order.
13. Cumulative Sum
Write a program that takes a list of integers and prints a new list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in the original list, plus the current element.
14. Unique Elements
Write a program that takes a list of integers and prints a list of only the unique elements (i.e., remove duplicates).
15. Guess the Number
Write a simple game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The program should provide feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
These problems will help you practice a variety of basic Python skills, including loops, conditionals, functions, and working with lists and strings. Feel free to reach out if you have questions about any of the problems!"""
